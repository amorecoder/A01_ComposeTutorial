# A01_ComposeTutorial
Jetpack Compose CodeLab01

This project is part of the series in learning Jetpack Compose. It follows the CodeLabs learning prescribe in Android Developer site.

However, I will be adding additional or high light important notes that will assist in mastering Compose.

At the end of this journey, I hope to be an expert in designing beautiful and functional UI using Compose.

Let's begin !

Important Notes and Observations:
Lesson 1 - Composable functions
1. Aside from using setContent from Activity or Fragment, a Composable can only be called from another Composable.
2. The @Preview annotation can only be applied to a Composable that DO NOT take in any parameter.

Lesson 2 - Layouts
1. Use Column to arrange item vertically. Use Row to arrange items horizontally, and use Box to stack elements.
2. Compose uses modifiers to change the composable's size, layout, appearance or add high-level interactions, such as making an element clickable. You can chain them to create richer composables.

Lesson 3 - Material Design
1. Material Design is built around three pillars: Color, Typography, and Shape.
